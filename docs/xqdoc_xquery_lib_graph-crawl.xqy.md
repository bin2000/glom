## Functions

### <a name="func_graph_bfs_3"/> graph:bfs\#3
```xquery
graph:bfs($s as sem:iri*, $limit as xs:integer, $adjV
)
```
  In-memory breadth-first search over a graph.  For example, to implement transitive closure over a particular predicate $pred, use:  graph:bfs($seeds, $limit, function($s) { cts:triples($s,$preds,())!sem:triple-object(.) })  Note that the only reference this function has to the graph comes from the behavior of the $adjV function.   


#### Params

* $s as  sem:iri\* the starting seeds, as IRIs found in a graph

* $limit as  xs:integer the maximum number of generations to explore

* $adjV a function that returns adjacent nodes. It should have the signature adjV($iri as sem:iri\*) as sem:iri\*


### <a name="func_graph_bfs-inner_4"/> graph:bfs-inner\#4
```xquery
graph:bfs-inner($visited as map:map, $queue as sem:iri*, $limit as xs:integer, $adjacentVertices
)
```

#### Params

* $visited as  map:map

* $queue as  sem:iri\*

* $limit as  xs:integer

* $adjacentVertices
